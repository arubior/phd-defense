<li>Our work ranges from a new <b><span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">low-level</span></b> algorithm for superpixel segmentation to
a more <b><span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">abstract interpretation </span></b> of images tied with their textual metadata
(first using entire images and then moving to a region-specific interpretation)</li>
<li>We evolve from the <b><span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">classical computer vision</span></b> approach used in the superpixel
segmentation to the usage of the nowadays ubiquitous <b><span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">CNNs</span></b> in subsequent chapters</li>

<h3>Future work</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our superpixel algorithm is well-suited to be <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">treated with CNNs</span>: inputs are images, and our energy functions can be used as losses</li>
<li>Replacing <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">AlexNet</span> by other architectures</li>
<li>Replacing the <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">contrastive loss</span> with triplet loss or magnet loss</li>
<li>Changing the bounding box proposals to use a <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">RPN</span></li>
<li>Switch from the discrete bounding box system to a more <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">continuous pixel-level</span> approach</li>
<li>Using some of the recent advances focused on <span class="fragment highlight-current-blue">attention</span></li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
Advantage: GPUs, try different optimizers, use data augmentation to regularize, get rid of hyperparameters<br>
ResNet or Inception-v4, that help with the vanishing gradient problem<br>
triplet maximizes distance between negative and minimies positives simultaneously<br>
magnet loss considers distributions of samples to respect intra-class variation and inter-class similarity in contrast to the unimodal separation enforced by the contrastive and triplet losses<br>
RPN would be x10 faster<br>
Use transformers for attention<br>
